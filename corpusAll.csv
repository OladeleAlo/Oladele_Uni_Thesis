They propose that these consumption changes can have three effects on psychological ownership: they can threaten it, cause it to transfer to other targets, and create new opportunities to preserve it. These changes and their effects are organized in a framework and examined across three macro trends in marketing: (1) growth of the sharing economy, (2) digitization of goods and services, and (3) expansion of personal data.

The empirical results show that ownership structure affects firm value and firm value, in turn, affects ownership structure. In particular, we found that the higher the ownership by member firms in the same business group is, the higher the firm value is. The evidence implies that vertical transaction between member firms through equity holding facilitates information flows, reduces transaction cost and then increases firm value. However, it appears that individual insider ownership is not statistically significant in explaining the relation with firm value.","2004-06","2023-11-22 17:07:42","2023-11-22 17:07:42","2023-11-22 17:07:42","195-197 vol. 3","","","3","","","Ownership structure, corporate governance and firm value","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings.

The owner of source code usually refers to the person that invented the code. However, larger code artifacts, such as files, are usually composed by multiple engineers contributing to the entity over time through a series of changes. Frequently, the person with the highest contribution, e.g. The most number of code changes, is defined as the code owner and takes responsibility for it. Thus, code ownership relates to the knowledge engineers have about code. Lacking responsibility and knowledge about code can reduce code quality. In an earlier study, Bird et al. [1] showed that Windows binaries that lacked clear code ownership were more likely to be defect prone. However recommendations for large artifacts such as binaries are usually not actionable. E.g. Changing the concept of binaries and refactoring them to ensure strong ownership would violate system architecture principles. A recent replication study by Foucault et al. [2] on open source software replicate the original results and lead to doubts about the general concept of ownership impacting code quality. In this paper, we replicated and extended the previous two ownership studies [1, 2] and reflect on their findings. Further, we define several new ownership metrics to investigate the dependency between ownership and code quality on file and directory level for 4 major Microsoft products. The results confirm the original findings by Bird et al. [1] that code ownership correlates with code quality. Using new and refined code ownership metrics we were able to classify source files that contained at least one bug with a median precision of 0.74 and a median recall of 0.38. On directory level, we achieve a precision of 0.76 and a recall of 0.60.","2015-05","2023-11-22 17:08:44","2023-11-22 17:08:44","2023-11-22 17:08:44","2-12","","","","","","Code Ownership and Software Quality","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2160-1860","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\D2KYVDGQ\7180062.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE/ACM 12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a model for clear determination of data ownership in information systems. Our intention is to show that there is an utmost need and practical possibility for formal definition of data ownership, including the clear definition of owners' responsibilities which are acceptable by all data owners. Model is based on enterprise architecture units called domains and smaller units called functional components. Applied domain model divide the complete business of a telecommunication company in to 12 domains where each domain represents a “natural” unit with clear responsibilities and competencies structured according to the business aspects. Although data ownership comprises several important responsibilities, approach taken in this paper is manly in respect to authorization of user access to data and validation of approved access. We propose to determine of which functional components information or network system is consistent of and that each functional component has to have an owner assigned. Owner of functional components becomes data owner of the applications which implements that functionality due to the fact that each functional component has its own data.","2012-05","2023-11-22 17:11:16","2023-11-22 17:11:16","2023-11-22 17:11:16","1534-1538","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2012 Proceedings of the 35th International Convention MIPRO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although prior work uncovers a link between code ownership heuristics and software quality, these heuristics rely solely on the authorship of code changes. In addition to authoring code changes, developers also make important contributions to a module by reviewing code changes. Indeed, recent work shows that reviewers are highly active in modern code review processes, often suggesting alternative solutions or providing updates to the code changes. In this paper, we complement traditional code ownership heuristics using code review activity. Through a case study of six releases of the large Qt and OpenStack systems, we find that: (1) 67%-86% of developers did not author any code changes for a module, but still actively contributed by reviewing 21%-39% of the code changes, (2) code ownership heuristics that are aware of reviewing activity share a relationship with software quality, and (3) the proportion of reviewers without expertise shares a strong, increasing relationship with the likelihood of having post-release defects. Our results suggest that reviewing activity captures an important aspect of code ownership, and should be included in approximations of it in future studies.","2016-05","2023-11-22 17:11:42","2023-11-22 17:11:42","2023-11-22 17:11:42","1039-1050","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1558-1225","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\GN62AXM5\7886978.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 IEEE/ACM 38th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we present SocialChain, which is a decentralized social data storage and sharing system based on blockchain that decouples user data and social applications to return data ownership to the user. We adopt Personal Data Store to extend off-chain storage for the social data, set up an identity establishment mechanism that can support WebID-based authentication functions using a unique identity assignment (i.e., WebID) as well as certificateless cryptography, and design a general framework that leverages smart contracts to help securely store and share social data in an automated manner. We develop a software prototype based on Ethereum and conduct case studies to test the effects of the adopted techniques on the performance. Experimental results show that SocialChain can provide easy-to-use interfaces while introducing relatively low latency, cost, and overhead and that it can support real-world social media applications.","2023-01","2023-11-22 17:13:07","2023-11-22 17:13:07","2023-11-22 17:13:07","600-614","","1","16","","","SocialChain","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identify four conceptual dimensions of calls for data ownership and argue that these help to systematize and to compare different positions. In view of this pluralism of data ownership claims, we introduce, spell out and defend a constructive interpretative proposal: claims for data ownership are charitably understood as attempts to call for the redistribution of material resources and the socio-cultural recognition of data subjects. We argue that as one consequence of this reading, it misses the point to reject claims for data ownership on the grounds that property in data does not exist.

As a digital economy takes shape, global inequalities however are rising sharply. Vertically integrated global digital corporations are set to rule every sector of the economy based on their exclusive control over its data, further concentrating economic power. There exists a political paralysis over regulation of such digital corporations. Any shift in the dominant digital model and practices towards greater fairness and sustainability requires first of all an examination of the political economy of data, and the digital intelligence that it contributes. Policy makers around the world are evidently becoming eager to explore ways for wide data sharing, with a view to its easy availability for domestic businesses.But there is a dearth of understanding and political will at the highest levels to develop the required new policies and laws for this purpose, as well as of viable practical models for data sharing. Very little theoretical work explores alternative models for economic governance of data. This paper attempts some new directions in this regard.The digital economy can be understood as comprising intelligent systems running whole sectors, employing data based digital intelligence to re-organize and coordinate them. Within such a macro understanding, it is possible to apply the framework of Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) developed by Elinor Ostrom to examine the management of data and digital intelligence resources at the community level in a given sector, like transport, under the dominant model. Such an analysis reveals very suboptimal results on almost all the key IAD evaluation parameters; from efficiency and equity to accountability and sustainability. The paper then proposes treating data and digital intelligence as common pool resources, under common property regimes.It briefly considers the kind of data governance arrangements that may be possible and necessary for a robust and fair digital economy. The discussion also subsumes key contemporary data related issues like the contestations around free global flows of data and the data rights of platform dependent actors, like taxi drivers and traders.","2019-11-01","2023-11-22 17:17:23","2023-11-22 17:17:23","2023-11-22 17:17:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\EKWXHVS8\Singh - 2019 - Data and Digital Intelligence Commons (Making a Ca.pdf","","","Data Commons; Data Governance; Digital Economy; Elinor Ostrom; Platform Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3873169","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the patent field, the advent of the AI in the inventive process questions the subjective/human state of the inventor. In particular, it is discussed whether, and to whom, the objects created by the AI can belong. And even if, due to their non-human origin, they are worthy of protection. This work aims to carry out a first reconnaissance of how the ownership regime of patentable inventions, under the Italian legislation and the European Patent Convention, can apply to AI's inventions. The analysis concludes that the existing patent system, at least in principle, is compatible with computational inventions, although it does not allow their patentability, at least at a procedural level. It is therefore necessary to consider an interpretative evolution, in particular by consolidating the transition from an inventor-centric system to an investment protection system. Finally, the article proposes some interpretative solutions to reconcile the patent system with the development of computational inventions.","2018-11-01","2023-11-22 17:17:36","2023-11-22 17:17:36","2023-11-22 17:17:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\N83GT49V\Banterle - 2018 - Ownership of Inventions Created by Artificial Inte.pdf","","","Artificial Intelligence; Patent Ownership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3276702","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extending this perspective to new media such as digital books and social media websites, interactivity can be thought of as a form of customization as it allows con-sumers to modify their exposures and experiences in ways not possible in more static digital environments (Liu and Shrum 2002). In this research we draw upon the notion of interactivity-as-customization as well as psychological ownership theory to address two unresolved issues in the literature. First, we note that consumer perceptions of new media interactivity are not well-predicted by the number or nature of available interactive features (Voorveld, Neijens, and Smit 2011). We propose that this may reflect heterogeneity in consumers' optimum stimu-lation level (OSL) since OSL is a major determinant of consumer responses in exploratory environments (Steenkamp 2011). Second, whereas much research has attempted to understand the drivers and dimensions of perceived interactivity, significantly less attention has been paid to understanding when and how perceived interactivity results in greater ""value in use"" (Vargo and Lusch 2004:7) and thus greater willingness to pay (WTP). We propose that the process of perceiving interactivity is a cognitive analogue of touching, manipulating, and customizing a product and that this process drives posi-tive affect, feelings of accomplishment, psychological ownership and ultimately, WTP. In this way, perceived interactivity plays a critical role in consumers' co-cre-ation of value during usage.","2013-02-15","2023-11-22 17:46:48","2023-11-22 17:46:48","","","","","","","","TOUCHING THE INTANGIBLE","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269574180_TOUCHING_THE_INTANGIBLE_%20PERCEPTIONS_OF_INTERACTIVITY_AND_OWNERSHIP_IN_NEW_MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, extant research in this context has not paid much attention to usability design of a virtual world and corresponding effects on users' psychological desire to own and control the space and objects within it and subsequent behavior intention. In this study, we apply concepts of Web site usability and psychological ownership to develop a model that illustrates the relationships between seven usability factors (legibility, firmness, coherence, variety, mystery, classic, and expressive visual aesthetics), four antecedents of psychological ownership (cognitive appraisals, perceived control, affective appraisals, and self-investment), psychological ownership, and use intention. A cross-sectional study with 239 Second Life users was conducted. The results demonstrate that designing a usable virtual world that induces strong psychological ownership is crucial to attract users to spend more time, participate in more activities, and revisit the virtual world. This is an important finding for forward-looking e-business managers looking to invest their limited resources in designing a usable virtual world. In addition, by using our model and corresponding survey items, designers can benchmark and evaluate the usability of their current virtual worlds, compare the results to the designs of competitors, and upgrade the offerings of virtual worlds, as needed, by allocating available resources to the most influential design factors to suit their specific needs.","2011-12-01","2023-11-22 17:48:17","2023-11-22 17:48:17","2023-11-22 17:48:17","269-308","","3","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.2753/MIS0742-1222280308","","","","","architectural quality model; human-computer interaction; landscape preference model; psychological ownership; usability; virtual worlds","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work presents initial explorations into the effects of varying touch-based interfaces on consumers, and argues that research into the interfaces used to access content can be as important as research into the content itself. Two laboratory studies using a variety of touch technologies explore how touchscreen interfaces can increase perceived psychological ownership, and this in turn magnifies the endowment effect. Touch interfaces also interact with importance of product haptics and actual interface ownership in their effects on perceived product ownership, with stronger effects for products high in haptic importance and interfaces that are owned. Results highlight that perceptions of online products and marketing activities are filtered through the lens of the interfaces used to explore them, and touch-based devices like tablets can lead to higher product valuations when compared to traditional computers.","2014-04-01","2023-11-22 17:49:04","2023-11-22 17:49:04","2023-11-22 17:49:04","226-233","","2","24","","Journal of Consumer Psychology","Tablets, touchscreens, and touchpads","Sensory perception, embodiment, and grounded cognition: Implications for consumer behavior","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Endowment; Haptics; Interface; Ownership; Touch; Touchscreen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fixed-effect panel data regression models are applied to a sample of 1,156 effective observations. To reflect the contextual role of resources, we defined industrial settings along with industrial complexity and firm scale dimensions. The empirical results supported our research hypotheses, showing that insider ownership exerts a positive effect on firm performance in a high-complexity and large-scale setting, but a negative effect in a low-complexity and smallscale setting. The results of this study imply that contextual fitness must be deliberately considered to determine effective regulations of corporate governance.

Moreover, we design a lazy update strategy to achieve efficient ownership management. For inside-user block-level deduplication, the user-aided key is used to realize convergent key management and reduce the key storage space.

Finally, we discuss about the category of devices which dominate the smart city system and conclude upon how HDI could shape the future of smart cities.","2016-04","2023-11-22 21:21:04","2023-11-22 21:21:04","2023-11-22 21:21:04","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In contrast, a number of empirical studies find considerable overlap in parties’ issues emphasis. Aiming to bridge this peculiar gap, this paper suggests that the development of exogenous problems is one factor that constrains parties’ incentives to talk past each other. Using comprehensive data on party attention to ten issues across six West European countries from approximately 1980 and onwards, the analysis shows that problems moderate the relationship between parties’ issue reputations and their issue emphases. When problems are moderate, parties selectively focus on different issues, but when problems become severe, parties across the board attend to an issue. That even includes parties that do not own the issue. These results have reassuring implications for parties’ responsiveness to societal problems that negatively affect the welfare of citizens.","2023-12-02","2023-11-22 21:31:13","2023-11-22 21:31:13","2023-11-22 21:31:10","2854-2885","","12","30","","","Avoiding or engaging problems?","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2022.2135754","","","","","issue overlap; Issue ownership; party competition; problem indicators; problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, both the definition and measurement of issue ownership—often drawn from Petrocik’s seminal 1996-article—is unclear. This constitutes a serious drawback to the further development and understanding of issue ownership itself and its purported effects. The paper addresses these problems by, first, establishing a definition of issue ownership at the individual level. On this basis, the standard ‘which party is best at handling issue X’ measure of issue ownership is assessed. The analyses using experiments embedded in a nationally representative panel survey indicate that the measure lacks validity and is partially redundant. Consequently, its replacement with a better performing alternative is recommended.","2018-06-01","2023-11-22 21:31:23","2023-11-22 21:31:23","2023-11-22 21:31:23","345-370","","2","40","","Polit Behav","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\7U8V7Y79\Stubager - 2018 - What is Issue Ownership and How Should We Measure .pdf","","","Issue ownership; Political parties; Public opinion; Question wording","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With product ownership (and responsibility for repair) remaining with providers, pay-per-use services are promoted as one such model, which can both increase product longevity and reduce the ‘burdens of ownership’ on consumers. However, PSS also require public acceptance of access-based consumption, including the long-term use of non-owned products and a range of accompanying contractual obligations. We conducted a series of deliberative workshops with the public, aiming to explore the concept of pay-per-use PSS and the role that concerns about ownership and responsibility may have in determining public acceptance. Rather than focusing on innate desires for product ownership, we found that participants’ concerns regarding pay-per-use PSS were usually related to wider fears surrounding the risks and responsibilities of entering into contract-based service agreements. Identifying four public narratives of service provision (Ownership and convenience; Risk and responsibility; Affordability and security; Care and control), we argue that successful introduction of PSS will only be possible if careful consideration is given to deeply held values pertaining to ownership, responsibility and trust that influence such cultural understandings.","2018-07","2023-11-22 21:31:31","2023-11-22 21:31:31","2023-11-22 21:31:31","2289","","7","10","","","Why Is Ownership an Issue?","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 7 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\7M8JSIPR\Cherry and Pidgeon - 2018 - Why Is Ownership an Issue Exploring Factors That .pdf","","","ownership; alternative ownership models; circular economy; product-service systems; public acceptance; responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ownership structure is related to energy efficiency and a change in ownership structure has a significant potential for energy saving. However, few papers have studied the impact of ownership structure on energy intensity from the perspective of technological innovation in the past. Based on panel data from 29 Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2020, we systematically investigate the impact of industrial department ownership structure on energy intensity and study the function of technological innovation in this relationship from the perspective of ownership heterogeneity by using empirical models including ordinary least squares, two-way fixed effects and random effects. The empirical results of this study reveal three findings. First, as the proportion of state-owned industrial enterprises increases by one unit, energy intensity increases by 0.803 units. However, as the proportion of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan-invested industrial enterprises, private industrial enterprises and foreign-invested industrial enterprises increases by one unit, energy intensity decreases by 0.847 units and 0.549 units. Second, R&D activities, FDI, capital intensity and exports can significantly reduce energy intensity, but imports can increase energy intensity. Third, the ownership structure can affect energy intensity by influencing R&D expenditure. The increase in the proportion of state-owned industrial enterprises can reduce R&D expenditure, but results in the opposite situation in private firms. Foreign-invested enterprises can reduce energy intensity by making more use of the parent company’s technology. Based on the above empirical results, we propose suggestions to reduce energy intensity, which can provide reference for government to formulate more effective energy policies and realize sustainable development.","2023-01","2023-11-22 21:36:13","2023-11-22 21:36:13","2023-11-22 21:36:13","8512","","11","15","","","The Impact of Ownership Structure on Technological Innovation and Energy Intensity","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 11 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\JCIXQ6IW\Zhang and Yu - 2023 - The Impact of Ownership Structure on Technological.pdf","","","energy intensity; industrial department; ownership structure; technological innovation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preconditions required for successful one master data implementation and usage in large high‐tech companies are presented and related current challenges companies have today are identified. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is qualitative in nature. First, literature was studied to find out the elements of one master data. Second, an interview study was carried out in eight high‐tech companies and in three expert companies. Findings – One master data management framework is the composition of data, processes and information systems. Accordingly, the key challenges related to the data are that the definitions of master data are unclear and overall data quality is poor. Challenges on processes related to managing master data are inadequately defined data ownership, incoherent data management practices and lack of continuous data quality practices. Integrations between applications are fundamental challenge to tackle when constructing an holistic one master data. Research limitations/implications – Studied companies are vanguards in the area of master data management (MDM), providing good views on topical issues in large companies. This study offers a general view of the topic but not describes special company situations as companies need to adapt the presented concepts for their specific case. Significant implication for future research is that MDM can no more be classified and discussed as only an IT problem but it is a managerial challenge which requires structural changes on mindset how issues are handled. Practical implications – This paper provides a better understanding over the issues which are impacting on the implementation of one master data. The preconditions of implementing and executing one master data are: an organization wide and defined data model; clear data ownership definitions; pro‐active data quality surveillance; data friendly company culture; the clear definitions of roles and responsibilities; organizational structure that supports data processes; clear data process definitions; support from the managerial level; and information systems that utilize the unified data model. The list of preconditions is wide and it also describes the incoherence of current understanding about MDM. This list helps business managers to understand the extent of the concept and to see that master data management is not only an IT issue. Originality/value – The existing practical research on master data management is limited and, for example, the general challenges have not been reported earlier. This paper offers practical research on one master data. The obtained results illustrates the extent of the topic and the fact that business relevant data management is not only an IT (application) issue but requires understanding of the data, its utilization in organization and supporting practices such as data ownership.","2011-01-01","2023-11-22 21:44:07","2023-11-22 21:44:07","2023-11-22 21:44:03","146-162","","1","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Group Publishing Limited","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\CAREMAJZ\html.html","","","Communication technologies; Data handling; Information systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach This study systematically reviews the literature surrounding beneficial ownership transparency to critically analyse the extent to which challenges facing the UK, impact upon its ability to successfully implement registers of beneficial owners. Findings This study demonstrates that a lack of beneficial ownership transparency facilitates money laundering by concealing corrupt wealth and frustrating authorities’ efforts to trace illicit finance. It demonstrates that implementing registers of beneficial owners may be a superficial approach to tackling the multifaceted problem of money laundering. Better intergovernmental cooperation is required to improve beneficial ownership transparency and to ensure measures to curb offshore money laundering are successful. Research limitations/implications This research focuses on one aspect of AML control from the UK’s perspective. Further work is needed to investigate the concerns from the perspective of offshore jurisdictions and how global AML rule affects developing economies.

However, despite attempts to broaden the measures for evaluating organizations and take seriously the social effects of business decisions, we lack a holistic framework for evaluating this public purpose that addresses aspirations like participation, democracy, equality, solidarity, and strong community relations alongside financial resilience and profitability. This study proposes that a solution can be found in Selznick’s concept of “moral community.” Selznick argued that community, conceived as a response to the perceived unravelling of the social fabric, plays a vital role in countering the excesses of capitalism. Using this as a yardstick to evaluate employee ownership (EO) in the UK, the author argues that the EO organizational field is indeed an embodiment of a moral community. It successfully infuses a broad range of social values into economic pursuits, nurtures an inclusive sense of the “common good,” and mitigates the alienation resulting from an increasingly marketized society. At the same time, the EO moral community does not reject capitalism as such, aspiring to connect with and reform existing political, financial, and legal structures as opposed to positioning its own institutions as an alternative to them. There are, therefore, limits to the challenge that the EO community levels against the current socioeconomic order.","2021-01-01","2023-11-22 21:44:07","2023-11-22 21:44:07","2023-11-22 21:44:07","83-112","","","72","","","Moral Community as a Yardstick for Alternative Organizations","Research in the Sociology of Organizations","","","","Emerald Publishing Limited","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","DOI: 10.1108/S0733-558X20210000072004","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\NNEM8ETM\html.html","","","Alternative organizations; Capitalism; Collectivist-democratic organizations; Communitarianism; Community; Employee ownership","K.

However, the available evidence suggests that the number of employee-owned firms is declining quite rapidly. This paper approaches the decline by using data on individuals in Estonian employee-owned firms. The key idea is that employee ownership can be sustainable only if it is extended also to new, incoming employees.We analyze the determinants of ownership in employee-owned firms and find out that new employees are excluded from ownership. While this finding is consistent with the literature on “degeneration” of employee-owned firms, it is not consistent with earlier empirical research. We argue that in developed economies, there are many countervailing forces that prevent the decline, but these are not in operation in Estonia. The peculiarity of Estonian findings is explained by different motives of entry of employee ownership vs. advanced market economies.

The use of IoT might yield many benefits for organizations engaged in civil infrastructure management, but these benefits might be difficult to realize as organizations are not equipped to handle and interpret this data. The purpose of this paper is to understand how IoT adoption affects decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach In this paper the changes in the business processes for managing civil infrastructure assets brought about by IoT adoption are analyzed by investigating two case studies within the water management domain. Propositions for effective IoT adoption in decision-making processes are derived. Findings The results show that decision processes in civil infrastructure asset management have been transformed to deal with the real-time nature of the data. The authors found the need to make organizational and business process changes, development of new capabilities, data provenance and governance and the need for standardization. IoT can have a transformative effect on business processes. Research limitations/implications Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the propositions further. Practical implications The paper shows that data provenance is necessary to be able to understand the value and the quality of the data often generated by various organizations.

More recent research indicates that such direct effects may be too simplistic, and in particular, an organization’s overall human skills are often not considered sufficiently. Inspired by the knowledge-based view, we therefore propose that interactions between three aspects of big data usage and management accountants’ data analytics skills may be key to reaching high-quality decisions. The purpose of this study is to test these predictions based on a survey of US firms. Design/methodology/approach The authors draw on survey data from 140 US firms. This survey has been conducted via MTurk in 2020. Findings The results of the study show that the quality of big data sources is associated with higher perceived levels of decision quality. However, according to the results, the breadth of big data sources and a data-driven culture only improve decision quality if management accountants’ data analytics skills are highly developed. These results point to the important, but so far unexamined role of an organization’s management accountants and their skills for translating big data into high-quality decisions. Practical implications The present study highlights the importance of an organization’s human skills in creating value out of big data. In particular, the findings imply that management accountants may need to increasingly draw on data analytics skills to make the most out of big data for their employers. Originality/value This study is among the first, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, to provide empirical proof of the relevance of an organization’s management accountants and their data analytics skills for reaching desirable firm-level outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach The article describes the results of the first stage in a multi-stage research project leading to methods for developing retention and disposition specifications and formal schedules for open data and big data initiatives. A fictitious organization is used to describe the characteristics of open data and big data initiatives, the gap between current approaches to setting retention and disposition specifications and schedules and what is required and how that gap can be closed. The landscape described as a result of this stage in the research will be tested in case studies established in the second stage of the project. Findings The argument is made that the business processes supporting open data and big data initiatives could serve as the basis for developing enhanced standards and procedures that are relevant to the characteristics of these two kinds of initiatives. The point is also made, however, that addressing the retention and disposition issues requires knowledge and leadership, both of which are in short supply in many organizations.

As government agencies start collecting and using such information, they must also deal with the issue of privacy, to comply with laws and regulations. The approach discussed here shows that record-keeping principles may form part of a solution to the issue of managing IoT-data for government agencies. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the generally accepted record-keeping principles as a basis for a high-level discussion on how IoT-data can be managed. This is followed by a presentation and discussion on how the Norwegian record-keeping standard, Noark, can be extended to highlight practical issues. Findings Record keeping has principles that are relevant to the management of IoT-data. Further an implementation of the chosen use-cases is possible based on an existing record keeping standard. Record keeping is one of many information science approaches that can manage IoT-data. Research limitations/implications The main limitations are that the discussion cannot cover all types of IoT-devices, nor can all issues be captured with a limited choice of examples. The results should be seen within the context of the types of devices discussed and limited to the chosen use-cases. However, the level of abstraction used means the results may be applicable to similar scenarios. Originality/value The approach shows that record-keeping principles may be used as an approach to manage IoT-data. This discussion is useful when compared with other information science approaches, e.g. big-data or semantic Web approaches. The practicalities of a record-keeping approach are also discussed and relevant strengths and weaknesses are showed.","2020-01-01","2023-11-22 21:53:17","2024-07-24 19:00:08","2023-11-22 21:53:16","221-239","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\YQ23JS4V\Sødring et al. - 2020 - A record-keeping approach to managing IoT-data for.pdf; C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\2EVB2N9I\html.html","","","Government; Internet of things; Privacy; Record keeping; Standards","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In so doing the chapter is conceptual; it discusses existing communicative theories in relation to current changes in the media landscape and its technological underpinnings. Focusing on the areas of crisis communication and issues management, we argue that datafication provides new ways of dealing with issues and, in turn, presents new issues for PR professionals. Thus, the chapter presents a novel conceptualization of PR in which technological affordances and agencies go hand in hand with human efforts in the configuration of communicative assemblages. More specifically, we argue that viewing data solely as an affordance merely provides new tools for solving existing issues. When the independent agency of data is recognized and employed, more effective means of solving such issues appear, but data itself also becomes an issue. The dilemma is best illustrated by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the broader discussions about electoral manipulation and other covert uses of data it incurred. In this regard, balancing the dual demands of efficacy and ethics is as pressing a concern for PR as ever. The conceptualization of PR in terms of communicative assemblages, we suggest, may not only explain processes of issues formation better, but also provide a starting point for handling such processes ethically and effectively.","2019-01-01","2023-11-22 21:55:29","2023-11-22 21:55:29","2023-11-22 21:55:25","25-38","","","4","","","When Data Is the Issue","Advances in Public Relations and Communication Management","","","","Emerald Publishing Limited","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","DOI: 10.1108/S2398-391420190000004003","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\EFCRR5KI\html.html","","","Affordance; Agency; Assemblage; Crisis communication; Datafication; Digitalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The notion of the commons acts as the prism to see how data may serve to foster this participatory “smart citizenship” around collective issues. This contribution critically engages with recent attempts to theorize the city as a commons. Instead of seeing the city as a whole as a commons, it proposes a more fine-grained perspective of the “commons-as-interface.” The “commons-as-interface,” it is argued, productively connects urban data to the human-level political agency implied by “the right to the city” through processes of translation and collectivization. The term is applied to three short case studies, to analyze how these processes engender a “right to the datafied city.” The contribution ends by considering the connections between two seemingly opposed discourses about the role of data in the smart city – the cybernetic view versus a humanist view. It is suggested that the commons-as-interface allows for more detailed investigations of mediation processes between data, human actors, and urban issues.","2019-01-01","2023-11-22 21:55:29","2023-11-22 21:55:29","2023-11-22 21:55:26","71-83","","","","","","The Right to the Datafied City","","","","","Emerald Publishing Limited","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","DOI: 10.1108/978-1-78769-139-120191005","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\RQF67N4V\html.html","","","Ownership; Collectivization; Commons-as-interface; Datafied city; Interfacing; Smart city; The right to the city; Translation; Urban commons","Cardullo, Paolo; Di Feliciantonio, Cesare; Kitchin, Rob","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The chapter moves on to discuss how the extraction and trade of data has revolutionised how elite sport is performed, manufactured, broadcast and consumed, shedding critical light on the role of the gambling industry in the exchange of human data as a market commodity.

By contrast, their misuse can lead to data workflows bypassing the intent of privacy and data protection law, as well as of ethical mandates. It may be referred to as the ‘creep factor’ of Big Data, and needs to be tackled right away, especially considering that we are moving towards the ‘datafication’ of society, where devices to capture, collect, store and process data are becoming ever-cheaper and faster, whilst the computational power is continuously increasing. If using Big Data in truly anonymisable ways, within an ethically sound and societally focussed framework, is capable of acting as an enabler of sustainable development, using Big Data outside such a framework poses a number of threats, potential hurdles and multiple ethical challenges. Some examples are the impact on privacy caused by new surveillance tools and data gathering techniques, including also group privacy, high-tech profiling, automated decision making and discriminatory practices. In our society, everything can be given a score and critical life changing opportunities are increasingly determined by such scoring systems, often obtained through secret predictive algorithms applied to data to determine who has value. It is therefore essential to guarantee the fairness and accurateness of such scoring systems and that the decisions relying upon them are realised in a legal and ethical manner, avoiding the risk of stigmatisation capable of affecting individuals’ opportunities. Likewise, it is necessary to prevent the so-called ‘social cooling’. This represents the long-term negative side effects of the data-driven innovation, in particular of such scoring systems and of the reputation economy. It is reflected in terms, for instance, of self-censorship, risk-aversion and lack of exercise of free speech generated by increasingly intrusive Big Data practices lacking an ethical foundation. Another key ethics dimension pertains to human-data interaction in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, which is increasing the volume of data collected, the speed of the process and the variety of data sources. It is urgent to further investigate aspects like the ‘ownership’ of data and other hurdles, especially considering that the regulatory landscape is developing at a much slower pace than IoT and the evolution of Big Data technologies. These are only some examples of the issues and consequences that Big Data raise, which require adequate measures in response to the ‘data trust deficit’, moving not towards the prohibition of the collection of data but rather towards the identification and prohibition of their misuse and unfair behaviours and treatments, once government and companies have such data. At the same time, the debate should further investigate ‘data altruism’, deepening how the increasing amounts of data in our society can be concretely used for public good and the best implementation modalities.","2021-01-01","2023-11-22 21:55:29","2023-11-22 21:55:29","2023-11-22 21:55:28","71-91","","","8","","","The Big Data World","Advances in Research Ethics and Integrity","","","","Emerald Publishing Limited","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","DOI: 10.1108/S2398-601820210000008007","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\NHKX4NKV\Bormida - 2021 - The Big Data World Benefits, Threats and Ethical .pdf","","","Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Data analytics; Dataveillance; Ethics challenges; Individuals’ control over personal data","Iphofen, Ron; O'Mathúna, Dónal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The substance of the debate and results of audience votes on the issues are presented in this paper as a means of initiating a broader debate on the issues, for it is with debate that we reach a group consensus on acceptable behavior and practice. With consensus, we can begin to develop codes and policies that are feasible and practical for ethical computer use.Specific dilemmas debated involved the issues of privacy and ownership, including the ethicality of using company resources for personal use and monitoring compliance to company policies about computer use. In general, we found little consensus about ethicality of any of the types of conduct, although we found a high degree of consensus that the debated issues were important and should continue to be discussed. The final question concerned policies and codes. While policies and codes were believed to be necessary, they were also perceived as ineffective. Several suggestions for practical action to enhance the efficacy of ethical codes are presented.","1998-04-01","2023-11-22 23:41:27","2023-11-22 23:41:27","2023-11-22 23:41:27","653-663","","6","17","","Journal of Business Ethics","Ownership, Privacy and Monitoring in the Workplace","","","","","","","en","1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","link.springer.com","","Company: Springer Distributor: Springer Institution: Springer Label: Springer Number: 6 Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IoT devices (nodes) are capable of capturing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing data about themselves and their physical world. Security and privacy are the major challenges in the implementation of IoT technology. Major privacy aspects in the IoT are stealing data, monitoring, and tracking, etc. Authentication, integrity, and confidentiality are major concerns for privacy and security preservation in the IoT. Computational intelligence (CI) focuses on the design and development of intelligent algorithms to solve real-time problems with minimum cost. The main goal of CI is to supplement natural and artificial intelligence to produce human-required competitive results.

The goal of the chapter is to define an economical and yet secure manner of meeting an organization's compliance needs for IT. The purpose of the information security is to preserve confidentiality (data is only accessed by those with the right to view the data), integrity (data can be relied upon to be accurate and processed correctly), and availability (data can be accessed when needed).

While major attention is currently given to the dominant model of corporate platforms collecting and economically exploiting massive amounts of personal data, other actors, such as small businesses, public bodies and civic society, take also part in data governance. The article sheds light on four models emerging from the practices of these actors: data sharing pools, data cooperatives, public data trusts and personal data sovereignty. We propose a social science-informed conceptualisation of data governance. Drawing from the notion of data infrastructure we identify the models as a function of the stakeholders’ roles, their interrelationships, articulations of value, and governance principles. Addressing the politics of data, we considered the actors’ competitive struggles for governing data. This conceptualisation brings to the forefront the power relations and multifaceted economic and social interactions within data governance models emerging in an environment mainly dominated by corporate actors. These models highlight that civic society and public bodies are key actors for democratising data governance and redistributing value produced through data. Through the discussion of the models, their underpinning principles and limitations, the article wishes to inform future investigations of socio-technical imaginaries for the governance of data, particularly now that the policy debate around data governance is very active in Europe.","2020","2023-11-23 00:15:27","2023-11-23 00:15:27","2023-11-23 00:15:27","1-15","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tilburg University Research Portal","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\VRUPP78P\Berti Suman et al. - 2020 - Emerging models of data governance in the age of d.pdf","","","Big Data; Data governance; data infrastructure; data policy; data politics; digital platforms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There has been a dramatic increase in the types of microdata, and this holds great promise for health services research. However, legislative efforts to protect individual privacy have reduced the flow of health care data for research purposes and increased costs and delays, affecting the quality of analysis.                                         Aim.               This paper provides an overview of the challenges raised by concerns about data confidentiality in the context of health services research, the current methodologies used to ensure data security, and a description of one successful approach to balancing access and privacy.                                         Materials and Methods.               We analyze the issues of access and privacy using a conceptual framework based on balancing the               risk               of reidentification with the               utility               associated with data analysis. The guiding principle should be to generate released data that are as close to the maximum acceptable risk as possible. HIPAA and other privacy measures can perhaps be seen as having had the effect of lowering the “maximum acceptable risk” level and rendering some data unreleasable.                                         Results.               We discuss the levels of risk and utility associated with different types of data used in health services research and the ability to link data from multiple sources as well as current models of data sharing and their limitations.                                         Discussion.               One particularly compelling approach is to establish a remote access “data enclave,” where statistical protections are applied to the data, technical protections ensure compliance with data‐sharing requirements, and operational controls limit researchers' access to the data they need for their specific research questions.                                         Conclusion.               We recommend reducing delays in access to data for research, increasing the use of remote access data enclaves, and disseminating knowledge and promulgating standards for best practices related to data protection.","2010-10","2023-11-23 00:22:40","2023-11-23 00:22:40","2023-11-23 00:22:20","1456-1467","","5p2","45","","Health Services Research","Balancing Access to Health Data and Privacy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\C4VGZSZF\PMC2965886.html; C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\M3W28A9G\Lane and Schur - 2010 - Balancing Access to Health Data and Privacy A Rev.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we give a mechanism that privately releases synthetic data useful for answering a class of queries over a               discrete               domain with error that grows as a function of the size of the smallest net approximately representing the answers to that class of queries. We show that this in particular implies a mechanism for counting queries that gives error guarantees that grow only with the VC-dimension of the class of queries, which itself grows at most logarithmically with the size of the query class.                                         We also show that it is not possible to release even simple classes of queries (such as intervals and their generalizations) over               continuous               domains with worst-case utility guarantees while preserving differential privacy. In response to this, we consider a relaxation of the utility guarantee and give a privacy preserving polynomial time algorithm that for any halfspace query will provide an answer that is accurate for some small perturbation of the query. This algorithm does not release synthetic data, but instead another data structure capable of representing an answer for each query. We also give an efficient algorithm for releasing synthetic data for the class of interval queries and axis-aligned rectangles of constant dimension over               discrete               domains.","2013-04","2023-11-23 00:22:40","2023-11-23 00:22:40","2023-11-23 00:22:26","1-25","","2","60","","J.

Since the maximum response is the upper boundary in each location, a small mean square indicates general superiority of the test cultivar. The method requires that all test cultivars be balanced over locations but not necessarily the checks. The advantage of the proposed method are: (i) The checks provide only a plausible maximum response for each location and are not required for assessing the test cultivars. Thus checks do not have to be present in all locations. This allows a greater flexibility for a breeder to choose locally adapted cultivars as checks without unduly increasing the size of a regional trial. (ii) The measure of general superiority consists of only one parameter, thus simplifying the screening process considerably. A subsidiary parameter for interaction can be used to indicate lack of general adaptability. (iii) The difference between the mean of the maximum response averaged over all locations and the mean of the best cultivar provides useful information as to how many cultivars are needed to achieve optimum productivity for the entire region, (iv) The specific adaptability of a cultivar can be identified by plotting the maximum and the test cultivar responses on the location means.Key words: Genotype × environment interaction, cultivar assessment, regional trial","1988-01-01","2023-11-23 00:23:44","2023-11-23 00:23:44","2023-11-23 00:23:24","193-198","","1","68","","Can.

There is a growing body of literature on data-oriented activism which aims to resist and counteract existing harmful data practices. However, little is known about the processes, policies, and political-economic structures that make datafication possible. There is a distinct research gap on situated and context-specific empirical research, which critically interrogates the premises, interests, and agendas of data-driven public administration and how stakeholders can impact them. This paper therefore studies the conditions of participation in public administration datafication. It asks the overall research question of how citizens are problematized and included in policy and practitioner discourse in the datafication of public administration. The paper takes Norway as its case and applies Cardullo and Kitchin’s scaffold of smart citizen participation at the system level. It makes use of a unique empirical insight into the field, consisting of a survey, interviews, and an extensive document analysis. Unexpectedly, we find that citizens and civil society are rarely engaged in this administrative reform. Instead, we identify a paternalistic, top-down, technocratic approach where the context, values, and agendas of datafication are obscured from the citizen.","2022-01","2023-11-23 00:24:59","2023-11-23 00:25:06","2023-11-23 00:24:38","205395172210893","","1","9","","Big Data & Society","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article analyses data as a form of capital that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data collection is driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a universe in which everything is made of data. The imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible influences many key decisions about business models, political governance, and technological development. This article argues that many common practices of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of data extraction, wherein data is taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By understanding data as a form capital, we can better analyse the meaning, practices, and implications of datafication as a political economic regime.","2019-01","2023-11-23 00:24:59","2023-11-23 00:25:12","2023-11-23 00:24:44","205395171882054","","1","6","","Big Data & Society","When data is capital","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But, to date, there are few analyses of real‐world experiences of datafication in developing country organizations.                                         Purpose               We address this knowledge gap by analysing evidence of big data in practice in relation to three key issues: implementation, value and power.                                         Approach and methods               Using interview, observation and documentary sources, we analyse the implementation and impact of big data systems in Indian electricity and transport public sector organizations.                                         Findings               Big data systems have been much slower to implement than anticipated, and the article exposes the nature and scale of the implementation challenge facing such systems. These are already delivering value for some managers within public service organizations but are, as yet, more operational than strategic and incremental not transformative. Big data systems are facilitating a shift in power from the public sector to the private sector, and from labour and middle management to panopticon‐type control by central managers. Big data intersects with politics especially around the imaginaries of wider stakeholders, changing their view of the financial and political issues that technology can address.                                         Policy implications               Policy‐makers and practitioners can better understand and plan for big data in development using three frameworks presented in the article: information value chain, decision pyramid, and big data–power model. These expose key issues of implementation, organizational value and power that must be incorporated into big data policy and projects. Benefits of datafication have been largely restricted to senior managers, private contractors and some politicians. To spread these to other stakeholders, including workers and citizens, action must be taken to address both practical and political issues arising in the datafication of development.","2021-01","2023-11-23 00:24:59","2023-11-23 00:25:13","2023-11-23 00:24:47","82-102","","1","39","","Development Policy Review","Datafication, value and power in developing countries","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and drawing from a combination of interviews and content analysis, it argues that this process leads activists to develop new rationalities around datafication that can support the agency of datafied publics. Three modulations of open source are identified: First, by regarding data as a prerequisite for generating knowledge, activists transform the sharing of source code to include the sharing of raw data. Sharing raw data should break the interpretative monopoly of governments and would allow people to make their own interpretation of data about public issues. Second, activists connect this idea to an open and flexible form of representative democracy by applying the open source model of participation to political participation. Third, activists acknowledge that intermediaries are necessary to make raw data accessible to the public. This leads them to an interest in transforming journalism to become an intermediary in this sense. At the same time, they try to act as intermediaries themselves and develop civic technologies to put their ideas into practice. The article concludes with suggesting that the practices and ideas of open data activists are relevant because they illustrate the connection between datafication and open source culture and help to understand how datafication might support the agency of publics and actors outside big government and big business.","2015-12-01","2023-11-23 00:24:59","2023-11-23 00:25:39","2023-11-23 00:24:50","205395171559463","","2","2","","Big Data & Society","Datafication and empowerment","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Основными целями данного исследования были выработка эмпирической методологии, позволяющей установить причинно-следственные взаимосвязи между элементами структуры собственности и корпоративной эффективностью и тестирование данной методологии с использованием высококачественных данных с развитого рынка. Для эмпирического тестирования гипотез в данной статье использовались панельные данные (выборка из 270 немецких компаний за 2000-2006 годы), первоначально собранные в исследовании Заутнера и Виллалонги (Sautner & Villalonga 2009) и дополненные авторами данной статьи. Используя инструментальные переменные и системы одновременных уравнений для установления причинно-следственных связей между корпоративным управление и корпоративной эффективностью, мы обнаружили положительное влияние институциональных инвесторов и отрицательное влияние инвесторов-""инсайдеров"" на корпоративную эффективность. В то же время причинно-следственные связи между характеристиками совета директоров и корпоративной эффективностью не могут быть установлены в отсутствие так называемого ""естественного эксперимента"", т.е. вынужденного изменения структуры совета директоров компаний под воздействием мер государственной политики (Black & Kim 2008), вследствие отсутствия инструментальных переменных для характеристик совета директоров. Проведённый в статье анализ позволил сформулировать два ключевых вывода в области государственной политики. Во-первых, ограничения на кросс-листинг компаний на зарубежных фондовых рынках приводят к более низкому уровню собственности иностранных инвесторов, что приводит к более низкой корпоративной эффективности. Во-вторых, взгляд на структуру собственности как на равновесное состояние, отстаиваемый Демсецем и Леном (Demsetz & Lehn 1985), не подтверждается для систем с концентрированной структурой собственности, где издержки изменения структуры собственности высоки (вследствие, например, высоких налогов на прирост капитала), поэтому государству следует принимать любые меры, способные привести к увеличению издержек продажи долей собственности, с осторожностью. Эмпирическая методология, разработанная в данной статье, может быть в дальнейшем использована для проведения исследований по данным с развивающихся рынков. Изучение взаимосвязи между корпоративным управлением и корпоративной эффективностью в условиях финансового кризиса является другим интересным направлением исследований.","2010-12-31","2023-11-23 00:57:55","2023-11-23 00:57:55","2023-11-23 00:57:55","34-56","","","3","","","The Relationship Between Corporate Governance and Company Performance in Concentrated Ownership Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","ISSN: 2073-0438 Issue: 4 Journal Abbreviation: КФ","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\TLWR2CR7\Ivashkovskaya and Zinkevich - 2010 - The Relationship Between Corporate Governance and .pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/cefe74058b6513890d65c5d5243b00709bd89411","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

IT Governance provides the means for decision making required to ensure that IT enables the organization to excel in its mission. IT systems are often viewed as monetary drains rather than seen as fundamental bases underpinning the strategic direction of organizations. IT implementations often do not meet requirements, fail, are over budget and the media is littered with headlines that corroborate these perceptions. IT projects are now so big, and they touch so many aspects of an organization, that they pose a singular new risk as according to Harvard Business Review Magazine that a $5 million project leads to an almost $200 million loss (Flyvbjerg and Budzier, 2011). Every organisation will have experienced complications of an IT implementation and this is why IT Governance is becoming a crucial factor to business survival no matter how large or small an organisation is.

Rapid change and rising costs have been mainstays of the Information Technology revolution. The emerging reality to organizations is that Information Technology must be used effectively. Concerns have been raised over IT effectiveness measurement, cost justification, and cost containment. Throughout the 1990’s, these problems have highly ranked among the key IT issues in studies conducted around the world. All resources need to be managed to realize opportunities. Isolating the benefits of Information Technology and relating them to the associated costs has proved elusive and threatened emerging opportunities. A change of approach has been advocated to overcome these problems which focuses on the Total Cost of Ownership. Over the past several years, the Total Cost of Ownership has been both hailed and scorned. The origins of the Total Cost of Ownership and its development provide the foundation for inquiry. The advantages and disadvantages of this cost measure are discussed from the extant management literature. Current usage of the Total Cost of Ownership is examined. Considerations of capacity levels, opportunity costs, and positive and negative externalities are introduced to focus on cost containment issues. The assessment identifies the pitfalls and opportunities in using the Total Cost of Ownership to ascertain the costs of Information Technology.","2000","2023-11-23 17:56:11","2023-11-23 17:56:11","2023-11-23 17:56:11","","","","","","","TOTAL COST OF IT OWNERSHIP AND USAGE","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/TOTAL-COST-OF-IT-OWNERSHIP-AND-USAGE%3A-REVIEW-AND-Drury/44a3cfdc9e1a406d24dccc1f846f50d8ff062180","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An implausible change to software is something that has never been changed in prior releases. When planning how to reduce defects, it is better to use plausible changes, i.e., changes with some precedence in the prior releases. To demonstrate these points, this paper compares several defect reduction planning tools. LIME is a local sensitivity analysis tool that can report the fewest changes needed to alter the classification of some code module (e.g., from “defective” to “non-defective”). TimeLIME is a new tool, introduced in this paper, that improves LIME by restricting its plans to just those attributes which change the most within a project. In this study, we compared the performance of LIME and TimeLIME and several other defect reduction planning algorithms. The generated plans were assessed via (a) the similarity scores between the proposed code changes and the real code changes made by developers; and (b) the improvement scores seen within projects that followed the plans. For nine project trails, we found that TimeLIME outperformed all other algorithms (in 8 out of 9 trials). Hence, we strongly recommend using past releases as a source of knowledge for computing fixes for new releases (using TimeLIME). Apart from these specific results, the other lesson from this paper is that our community might be more careful about using off-the-shelf AI tools, without first applying SE knowledge (e.g., that past releases are a good source of knowledge for planning defect reductions). As shown here, once that SE knowledge is applied, this can result in dramatically better reasoning.","2022-07-01","2023-11-24 00:03:43","2023-11-24 00:03:43","2023-11-24 00:03:43","2510-2525","","7","48","","IIEEE Trans.

Such algorithms are usually commissioned and certified using data from outside the SE domain. Can we assume that such algorithms can be used ''off-the-shelf'' (i.e. with no modifications)? To say that another way, are there special features of SE problems that suggest a different and better way to use AI tools?  To answer these questions, this paper reports experiments with TimeLIME, a variant of the LIME explanation algorithm from KDD'16. LIME can offer recommendations on how to change static code attributes in order to reduce the number of defects in the next software release. That version of LIME used an internal weighting tool to decide what attributes to include/exclude in those recommendations. TimeLIME improves on that weighting scheme using the following SE knowledge: software comes in releases; an implausible change to software is something that has never been changed in prior releases; so it is better to use plausible changes, i.e. changes with some precedent in the prior releases. By restricting recommendations to just the frequently changed attributes, TimeLIME can produce (a)~dramatically better explanations of what causes defects and (b)~much better recommendations on how to fix buggy code.  Apart from these specific results about defect reduction and TimeLIME, the more general point of this paper is that our community should be more careful about using off-the-shelf AI tools, without first applying SE knowledge. As shown here, it may not be a complex matter to apply that knowledge. Further, once that SE knowledge is applied, this can result in dramatically better systems.","2020-03-15","2023-11-24 00:03:57","2023-11-24 00:03:57","2023-11-24 00:03:57","","","","","","","How to Improve AI Tools (by Adding in SE Knowledge)","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\YJY7F89U\Peng and Menzies - 2020 - How to Improve AI Tools (by Adding in SE Knowledge.pdf; ","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/How-to-Improve-AI-Tools-(by-Adding-in-SE-with-the-Peng-Menzies/ea67aedf3f6d0ef2131b1e015e99b827d6d980a3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These trace links can help engineers reduce the time and complexity of software maintenance. The information retrieval (IR) technique has been widely used in requirement traceability. It uses the textual similarity between software artifacts to create links. However, if two artifacts do not share or share only a small number of words, the performance of the IR can be very poor. Some methods have been developed to enhance the IR by considering relations between target artifacts, but they have been limited to code rather than to other types of target artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose an automatic method that combines the IR method with the close relations between target artifacts. Specifically, we leverage close relations between target artifacts rather than just text matching from requirements to target artifacts. Moreover, the method is not limited to the type of target artifacts when considering the relations between target artifacts. We conduct experiments on five public datasets and take account of trace links between requirements and different types of software artifacts. Results show that under the same recall, the precisions on the five datasets improve by 40%, 8%, 20%, 4%, and 6%, respectively, compared with the baseline method. The precision on the five datasets improves by an average of 15.6%, showing that our method outperforms the baseline method when working under the same conditions.","2021-07","2023-11-24 00:04:10","2023-11-24 00:04:10","2023-11-24 00:04:10","957-968","","7","22","","Front Inform Technol Electron Eng","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Analyzing-close-relations-between-target-artifacts-Wang-Shen/a30372ae3934fc1bc3d53777c96cb6ca1462fa1b","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, establishing requirements trace links is a tedious, labor-intensive and fallible task. To alleviate this problem, Information Retrieval (IR) methods, such as Vector Space Model (VSM), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and their variants, have been widely used to establish trace links automatically. But with the widespread use of agile development methodology, artifacts that can be used to generate automatic tracing links are getting shorter and shorter, which decreases the effects of traditional IR-based trace link generation methods. In this paper, Biterm Topic Model–Genetic Algorithm (BTM–GA), which is effective in managing short-text artifacts and configuring initial parameters, is introduced. A hybrid method VSM[Formula: see text]BTM–GA is proposed to generate requirements trace links. Empirical experiments conducted on five real and frequently-used datasets indicate that (1) the hybrid method VSM+BTM[Formula: see text]GA outperforms the others, and its results can achieve the “Good” level, where recall and precision are no less than 70% and 30%, respectively; (2) the performance of the hybrid method is stable and (3) BTM–GA can provide a number of “hard-to-find” trace links that complement the candidate trace links of VSM.","2020-07","2023-11-24 00:04:27","2023-11-24 00:04:27","2023-11-24 00:04:27","1005-1048","","07","30","","Int.

These trace links can provide important support to software maintenance and evolution tasks. Information Retrieval (IR) is now widely accepted as the key technique of semi-automatic tools to recover candidate trace links based on textual similarities among artifacts. However, the vocabulary mismatch problem between different artifacts hinders the performance of these IR-based approaches. Thus, a growing body of enhancing strategies were proposed based on user feedback. They allow to adjust the textual similarities of candidate links after users accept or reject part of these links. Recently, several approaches successfully used this strategy to improve the performance of IR-based traceability recovery. However, these approaches require a large amount of user feedback, which is infeasible in practice. In this paper, we propose to improve IR-based traceability recovery by introducing only a small amount of user feedback into the closeness analysis on call and data dependencies in code. Specifically, our approach iteratively asks users to verify a chosen candidate link based on the quantified functional similarity for each code dependency (called closeness) and the generated IR values. The verified link is then used as the input to re-rank the unverified candidate links. An empirical evaluation based on five real-world systems shows that our approach can outperform four baseline approaches by using only a small amount of user feedback.","2019-05","2023-11-24 00:04:36","2023-11-24 00:04:36","2023-11-24 00:04:36","369-379","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","Conference Name: 2019 IEEE/ACM 27th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC) ISBN: 9781728115191 Place: Montreal, QC, Canada Publisher: IEEE","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Using-Frugal-User-Feedback-with-Closeness-Analysis-Kuang-Gao/4885b4286f596667ccac4cbcb086e2c68fc6154a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research seeks methods that generate demonstrably useful guidance on “what to do” within the context of a specific software project. Specifically, we propose XTREE (for within-project planning) and BELLTREE (for cross-project planning) to generating plans that can improve software quality. Each such plan has the property that, if followed, it reduces the expected number of future defect reports. To find this expected number, planning was first applied to data from release x. Next, we looked for change in release x + 1 that conformed to our plans. This procedure was applied using a range of planners from the literature, as well as XTREE. In 10 open-source JAVA systems, several hundreds of defects were reduced in sections of the code that conformed to XTREE’s plans. Further, when compared to other planners, XTREE’s plans were found to be easier to implement (since they were shorter) and more effective at reducing the expected number of defects.","2020-09","2023-11-24 00:04:44","2023-11-24 00:04:44","2023-11-24 00:04:44","3468-3500","","5","25","","Empir Software Eng","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","","","; C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\3TIR2WM8\Krishna and Menzies - 2020 - Learning actionable analytics from multiple softwa.pdf","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Learning-actionable-analytics-from-multiple-Krishna-Menzies/e52efd3c47a354c2030137573cebfb02d91fa309","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper investigate show human analysts perform when vetting candidate RTMs. Specifically, a study was undertaken at two universities and had 26 participants analyze RTMs of varying accuracy for a Java code formatter program.

Currently, human intervention happens at the end of the traceability process, after candidate traceability links have already been generated. This often leads to a decline in the results' accuracy. In this paper, we propose an approach, based on semantic relatedness (SR), which brings human judgment to an earlier stage of the tracing process by integrating it into the underlying retrieval mechanism. SR tries to mimic human mental model of relevance by considering a broad range of semantic relations, hence producing more semantically meaningful results. We evaluated our approach using three datasets from different application domains, and assessed the tracing results via six different performance measures concerning both result quality and browsability. The empirical evaluation results show that our SR approach achieves a significantly better performance in recovering true links than a standard Vector Space Model (VSM) in all datasets. Our approach also achieves a significantly better precision than Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in two of our datasets.","2012-06","2023-11-24 00:06:30","2023-11-24 00:06:30","2023-11-24 00:06:30","183-192","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","Conference Name: 2012 IEEE 20th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC) ISBN: 9781467312165 9781467312134 9781467312158 Place: Passau, Germany Publisher: IEEE","","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-semantic-relatedness-approach-for-traceability-Mahmoud-Niu/cba7bb6f564d44be193fef33014e676df34a3fb4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nature of change efforts is such that they often do not equally affect the various roles in the organization, which indicates that the roles may hold different attitudes. This study aimed to verify the existence of these presumed differences in attitudes towards organizational change between roles in a software engineering organization and to identify factors that contribute to these differences. The result of a survey (N=51) confirmed that there were significant differences, and that the software developers had a more positive attitude towards change and had deeper knowledge about the intended outcome compared to the line managers. The result of in-depth interviews (N=11) revealed that the software engineers evaluate the planned change in relation to the norms, values and standards of their peer group, meaning that an employee will have a positive attitude towards a change if its result is likely to make, or has made, it easier for him/her to uphold the peer group's norms and values.","2016-05-14","2023-11-24 00:06:49","2023-11-24 00:06:49","2023-11-24 00:06:49","1-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Semantic Scholar","","Conference Name: ICSE '16: 38th International Conference on Software Engineering ISBN: 9781450341554 Place: Austin Texas Publisher: ACM","[TLDR] This study aimed to verify the existence of presumed differences in attitudes towards organizational change between roles in a software engineering organization and to identify factors that contribute to these differences.","","https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/An-Initial-Analysis-of-Differences-in-Software-Lenberg-Al%C3%A9groth/386656fc4321711f39687e9fe55aa0be79fe6c7a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is often regarded as an investment that comes at the expense of shareholders. In contrast, research analyzing the connections between the equity ownership structure of a company and its level of CSR engagement suggests that CSR offers benefits to shareholders that go beyond direct financial returns from investments. This study provides a comprehensive review and systematic assessment of theoretical considerations and approaches regarding different forms of equity ownership and their relationships to CSR, and it discusses the relevant benefits and motivations of shareholders. The perceived value of these CSR benefits varies among different types of shareholders, as they assign unequal values to short-term financial or to rather long-term CSR benefits. Based on a literature sample of 146 publications, this review demonstrates central problems inherent in previous analyses. Given the ambiguous and partially contradictory findings of prior research, this study identifies potential moderating influences that help clarify empirical evidence.

The aim of this article was to provide an overview of what is known about the effects on economic, administrative and health related outcomes of different types of ownership of healthcare providers -namely public, private non-for-profit (PNFP) and private for-profit (PFP)- based on the findings of systematic reviews (SR). Methods and Findings An overview of systematic reviews was performed. Different databases were searched in order to select SRs according to an explicit comprehensive criterion. Included SRs were assessed to determine their methodological quality. Of the 5918 references reviewed, fifteen SR were included, but six of them were rated as having major limitations, so they weren't incorporated in the analyses. According to the nine analyzed SR, ownership does seem to have an effect on health and healthcare related outcomes. In the comparison of PFP and PNFP providers, significant differences in terms of mortality of patients and payments to facilities have been found, both being higher in PFP facilities. In terms of quality and economic indicators such as efficiency, there are no concluding results. When comparing PNFP and public providers, as well as for PFP and public providers, no clear differences were found. Conclusion PFP providers seem to have worst results than their PNFP counterparts, but there are still important evidence gaps in the literature that needs to be covered, including the comparison between public and both PFP and PNFP providers. More research is needed in low and middle income countries to understand the impact on and development of healthcare delivery systems.","2014-12-01","2023-11-25 17:55:01","2023-11-25 17:55:01","2023-11-25 17:55:01","e93456","","12","9","","PLOS ONE","Does Ownership Matter?","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\KVNM3KWP\Herrera et al. - 2014 - Does Ownership Matter An Overview of Systematic R.pdf","","","Allied health care professionals; Database searching; Health care facilities; Health care providers; Health economics; Hospitals; Low and middle income countries; Systematic reviews","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As Frances et al. have aptly noted, any analysis of social nature begs the question: ‘with what theoretical tools do we approach the analysis of events and processes?’ (p. 1). In land matters, for example, Malpezzi (1999b,c) has keenly observed that most of the studies on land reforms have focused on the rural and agricultural sectors, at the expense of the urban sector. Arguably, the paucity of land policy/reform studies on the urban sector could be explained, to a large measure, by the fact that most of the studies carried out in this area apply theoretical frameworks or models that are highly abstract (e.g. neoclassical economic models) or too simplistic in approach.11On the methodology of economics, Case (1986: 5) asserts that: ‘To answer real-world questions one must deal explicitly with the institutional, social and political context within which economic forces operate.’ Consistent with Coase (1992a), Case notes, however, that for the sake of simplicity of understanding of the underlying economic factors, economists strip off the institutional details from their theories or models. Such models or methodological frameworks may not be readily applicable or efficacious in explaining the convoluted urban land market realities. The narrow option for alternative tools of analysis for studying land market ‘events and processes’ (to use Frances et al.’s (1991) terminology) may well have hindered land policy/reform research in the urban sector. Against that background, this paper advances an eclectic, property-rights-based approach that is robust and versatile enough to have wide application. An empirical study conducted under the framework attests to the relevance of such an approach to land use policy and urban land market analysis.","2009-02-01","2023-11-25 17:57:34","2023-11-25 17:57:34","2023-11-25 17:57:34","43-85","","2","71","","Progress in Planning","Property rights, transaction costs and institutional change","Property Rights, Transaction Costs and Institutional Change: Conceptual Framework and Literature Review","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\6X469PK5\S0305900608000731.html","","","Literature review; Conceptual framework; Institutional change; New institutional economics; Property rights; Transaction costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can only be achieved when the necessary staff and resources are available. OBJECTIVES The objective of this work is to identify challenges health IT companies are confronted with related to personnel capacities and skilled workers. METHODS Using a questionnaire distributed through newsletters and social media among representatives of software companies and hospitals we collected information on current hurdles of health software providers and their strategies to overcome these in order to address the demands of the digital health transformation. RESULTS The main findings of the survey are that scarce resources in software development are among the reasons for not achieving strategic goals on time in the health IT sector and for not being able to react flexibly to market changes. A strategy to overcome missing expert knowledge and own resources without free capacity is to hire external resources. CONCLUSIONS With the ever-changing landscape of digital health, it is essential to have skilled workers with knowledge on the peculiarities of clinical workflows. The existing shortage of skilled workers leads to a reduction of innovative power in the health IT sector, potentially slowing down the digital health transformation.","2023-05-02","2023-11-27 10:40:27","2023-11-27 10:40:27","2023-11-27 10:40:27","6-11","","","301","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","typeset.io","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\BEHP2SR9\2023 - How Does Shortage of Health IT Professionals Impac.pdf; C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\UJ3JSMG7\how-does-shortage-of-health-it-professionals-impact-on-the-161u6vk5.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software failures during a manned mission can cause loss of life, so there are severe requirements to make the software as safe and reliable as possible. Typically, verification and validation (V&V) has the task of making sure that all software errors are found before the software is deployed and that it always conforms to the requirements. Experience, however, shows that this gold standard of error-free software cannot be reached in practice. Even if the software alone is free of glitches, its interoperation with the hardware (e.g., with sensors or actuators) can cause problems. Unexpected operational conditions or changes in the environment may ultimately cause a software system to fail. Is there a way to surmount this problem? In most modern aircraft and many automobiles, hardware such as central electrical, mechanical, and hydraulic components are monitored by IVHM (Integrated Vehicle Health Management) systems. These systems can recognize, isolate, and identify faults and failures, both those that already occurred as well as imminent ones. With the help of diagnostics and prognostics, appropriate mitigation strategies can be selected (replacement or repair, switch to redundant systems, etc.). In this short paper, we discuss some challenges and promising techniques for software health management (SWHM). In particular, we identify unique challenges for preventing software failure in systems which involve both software and hardware components. We then present our classifications of techniques related to SWHM. These classifications are performed based on dimensions of interest to both developers and users of the techniques, and hopefully provide a map for dealing with software faults and failures.","2009-07-21","2023-11-27 10:42:28","2023-11-27 10:42:28","2023-11-27 10:42:28","","","","","","","Software Health Management","","","","","","","en","","","","","typeset.io","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\ZNZPM2FT\2009 - Software Health Management A Short Review of Chal.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an alternative to fixed-size, dedicated clusters, we propose a dynamically-shared application cluster model based on virtual machines. The system is dubbed ""OnCall"" for the extra computing capacity that is always on call in case of traffic spikes. OnCall's approach to spike management relies on the use of an economically-efficient marketplace of cluster resources. OnCall works autonomically by allowing applications to trade computing capacity on a free market through the use of automated market policies; the appropriate applications are then automatically activated on the traded nodes. As demonstrated in our prototype implementation, OnCall allows applications to handle spikes while still maintaining inter-application performance isolation and providing useful resource guarantees to all applications on the cluster.","2004-05-17","2023-11-27 10:48:08","2023-11-27 10:48:08","2023-11-27 10:48:08","198-205","","","","","","OnCall","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","en","","","","","typeset.io","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\95IUF5HU\2004 - OnCall defeating spikes with a free-market applic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Autonomic Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although for data management, processing, and obtainability, cloud computing is considered a well-known approach for organizational development on the internet. Despite many advantages, cloud computing has still numerous security challenges that can affect the big-data usage on cloud computing. To find the security issues/challenges that are faced by software vendors’ organizations we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) through which we have find out 103 relevant research publications by developing a search string that is inspired by the research questions. This relevant data was comprised from different databases e.g. Google Scholar, IEEE Explore, ScienceDirect, ACM Digital Library, and SpringerLink. Furthermore, for the detailed literature review, we have accomplished all the steps in SLR, for example, development of SLR protocol, Initials and final assortment of the relevant data, data extraction, data quality assessment, and data synthesis. We identified fifteen (15) critical security challenges which are: data secrecy, geographical data location, unauthorized data access, lack of control, lack of data management, network-level issues, data integrity, data recovery, lack of trust, data sharing, data availability, asset issues, legal amenabilities, lack of quality, and lack of consistency. Furthermore, sixty four (64) standard practices are identified for these critical security challenges using the proposed SLR that could help vendor organizations to overcome the security challenges for big data. The findings of our research study demonstrate the resemblances and divergences in the identified security challenges in different periods, continents, databases, and methods. The proposed SLR will also support software vendor organizations for securing big data on the cloud computing platforms.

They are often considered to be a reliable source of evidence for making healthcare decisions. Unfortunately, problems among meta-analyses such as the misapplication and misinterpretation of statistical methods and tests are long-standing and widespread. The purposes of this statement are to review key steps in the development of a meta-analysis and to provide recommendations that will be useful for carrying out meta-analyses and for readers and journal editors, who must interpret the findings and gauge methodological quality. To make the statement practical and accessible, detailed descriptions of statistical methods have been omitted. Based on a survey of cardiovascular meta-analyses, published literature on methodology, expert consultation, and consensus among the writing group, key recommendations are provided.

However, scant research is available validating these claims. This study aimed to review the recent peer reviewed literature to better describe the body of knowledge surrounding the relationship between pet ownership and mental health. A literature search was conducted in May 2020 using two databases to identify articles that met inclusion/exclusion criteria. After title review, abstract review, and then full article review, 54 articles were included in the ﬁnal analysis. Of the 54 studies, 18 were conducted in the general population, 15 were conducted in an older adult population, eight were conducted in children and adolescents, nine focused on people with chronic disease, and four examined a speciﬁc unique population. Forty-one of the studies were cross-sectional, 11 were prospective longitudinal cohorts, and two were other study designs. For each of the articles, the impact of pet ownership on the mental health of owners was divided into four categories: positive impact (n = 17), mixed impact (n = 19), no impact (n = 13), and negative impact (n = 5). Among the reviewed articles, there was much variation in population studied and study design, and these differences make direct comparison challenging. However, when focusing on the impact of pet ownership on mental health, the results were variable and not wholly supportive of the beneﬁt of pets on mental health. Future research should use more consistent methods across broader populations and the development of a pet-ownership survey module for use in broad, population surveys would afford a better description of the true relationship of pet ownership and mental health.","2021-12-16","2023-11-28 22:24:34","2023-11-28 22:24:35","2023-11-28 22:24:34","332","","12","8","","Veterinary Sciences","Pet Ownership and Quality of Life","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Thesis Project\OLA\SLR sample 2.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach is however associated with acute and late toxicities including haematological, skin, bowel function and genito-urinary complications. This paper systematically reviews studies addressing the quality of life (QoL) implications of anal cancer and radiochemotherapy. The paper also evaluates how QoL is assessed in anal cancer. Methods Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched for publications (1996-2014) reporting the effects on patients of anal cancer and radiochemotherapy. Results Of the 152 papers reporting treatment-related effects on patients, only 11 provided a formal assessment of QoL. In the absence of an anal cancer specific measure, QoL was assessed using generic cancer instruments such as the core EORTC quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQC30) or colorectal cancer tools such as the EORTC QLQ-CR29. Bowel function, particularly diarrhoea, and sexual problems were the most commonly reported QoL concerns. The review of QoL issues of anal cancer patients treated with radiochemotherapy is limited by the QoL assessment measures used. It is argued that certain treatment-related toxicities, for example skin-induced radiation problems are overlooked or inadequately represented in existing measures. Conclusions This review emphasises the need to develop an anal cancer specific QoL measure and to incorporate QoL as an outcome of future trials in anal cancer. The results of this review are informative to clinicians and patients in terms of treatment decision making.","2015-12","2023-11-28 22:24:38","2024-07-24 15:46:20","2023-11-28 22:24:38","3613-3623","","12","23","","Support Care Cancer","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\Thesis Project\OLA\SLR sample.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Cosine Similarity Method was used to calculate the similarities between the two documents. The advantage of this method is that, it is not affected by the length of the document, but rather by the value of each document's terms and its low error rate. Based on the performance testing of this method application using the K-Fold Cross Validation technique, with testing of 6 fold for each data randomization set 6 times, against 126 instances of economic article journals, the average accuracy results were 57,79%, precision was 57,79%, and recall was 62,96%.

Consequently, many approaches, including those based on statistical theory, machine learning, and classifier performance improvement, have been proposed for improving text classification performance. Among these approaches, centroid-based classifier, multinomial naïve bayesian (MNB), support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN) are commonly used. In this paper, we introduce a cosine similarity-based methodology for improving performance. The methodology combines cosine similarity (between a test document and fixed categories) with conventional classifiers such as MNB, SVM, and CNN to improve the accuracy of the classifiers, and then we call the conventional classifiers with cosine similarity as enhanced classifiers. We applied the enhanced classifiers to famous datasets – 20NG, R8, R52, Cade12, and WebKB – and evaluated the performance of the enhanced classifiers in terms of the confusion matrix’s accuracy; we obtained outstanding results in that the enhanced classifiers show significant increases in accuracy. Moreover, through experiments, we identified which of two considered knowledge representation techniques (word count and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF)) is more suitable in terms of classifier performance.","2020-04-15","2023-11-29 19:58:44","2023-11-29 19:58:44","2023-11-29 19:58:44","396-411","","5","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/08839514.2020.1723868","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\J7S96F74\Park et al. - 2020 - A Methodology Combining Cosine Similarity with Cla.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we used this important measure to investigate the performance of Arabic language text classification. For textual features, vector space model (VSM) is generally used as a model to represent textual information as numerical vectors. However, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a better textual representation technique as it maintains semantic information between the words. Hence, we used the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to extract textual features based on LSI. In our experiments, we conducted comparison between some of the well-known classification methods such as Naïve Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and classification tree. We used a corpus that contains 4,000 documents of ten topics (400 document for each topic). The corpus contains 2,127,197 words with about 139,168 unique words. The testing set contains 400 documents, 40 documents for each topics. As a weighing scheme, we used Term Frequency.Inverse Document Frequency (TF.IDF). This study reveals that the classification methods that use LSI features significantly outperform the TF.IDF-based methods. It also reveals that k-Nearest Neighbors (based on cosine measure) and support vector machine are the best performing classifiers.","2017-04-01","2023-11-29 20:43:15","2023-11-29 20:43:15","2023-11-29 20:43:15","189-195","","2","29","","Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences","","Arabic Natural Language Processing: Models, Systems and Applications","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\JGE4ZTMV\S1319157816300210.html","","","Arabic text; Classification; Cosine similarity; Latent Semantic Indexing; Supervised learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This definition stems from the basics of a company's business functions; several common threads lead to a fundamental definition. At the root of business you find a basic equation: assets+people=profits. Since this equation underlies basic business fundamentals, business managers must support each aspect of the equation, and asset management tools and processes must address each area. Companies must possess certain competencies to maximize their effectiveness in each area. Ownership data allows companies to look at their asset base from a strategic business perspective. Help desk and deployment tools remain tactical tools to solve today's problems. Separately or together they do not constitute asset management. To truly manage assets we need all three competencies. Help desks support people and deployment tools support the assets.

It covers the central aspects of a potential new property right regarding data: its rationale, characteristics, and implementation. Market failure can be a consequence of overly high transaction costs. According to literature, data ownership could correct this market failure by lowering transaction costs for contractual agreements involving data and by correcting a misallocation of costs and benefits, that is, the fact that data collectors are able to externalize costs while internalizing benefits. Data may be protected at three distinct levels: at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic level. According to World Economic Forum taxonomy, volunteered data is explicitly shared by individuals. If individuals share data that is not by them but rather about them, this data should be qualified as observed data. Finally, inferred data refers to different data types originating from various sources, used mostly for predictive purposes.","2017","2023-11-30 19:11:26","2024-07-18 19:31:10","","","","","","","","Data ownership","","","","","CRC Press","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As with many new technologies, its legal and personal implications are not well understood until the technology has matured. Data ownership has by default resided with organisations that hold the data; utility companies, websites, retailers and data aggregators and brokers. If data could be owned by the people it identifies, the data handlers would have to pay to use that data for sales and marketing purposes. We are not suggesting payment would be the mostly illusory free services and hidden discounts that are the current answer but real money or an asset that can be bartered or purchased. If even the poorest people can gain an income this would revolutionise personal finance for those who register on the web either for purchases or to make their name available for use.

However, due to the increasing medical-scientific research output, it is a time-consuming task to conduct systematic reviews. To accelerate this process, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in the review process. In this communication paper, we suggest how to conduct a transparent and reliable systematic review using the AI tool ‘ASReview’ in the title and abstract screening. Methods Use of the AI tool consisted of several steps. First, the tool required training of its algorithm with several prelabelled articles prior to screening. Next, using a researcher-in-the-loop algorithm, the AI tool proposed the article with the highest probability of being relevant. The reviewer then decided on relevancy of each article proposed. This process was continued until the stopping criterion was reached. All articles labelled relevant by the reviewer were screened on full text. Results Considerations to ensure methodological quality when using AI in systematic reviews included: the choice of whether to use AI, the need of both deduplication and checking for inter-reviewer agreement, how to choose a stopping criterion and the quality of reporting. Using the tool in our review resulted in much time saved: only 23% of the articles were assessed by the reviewer. Conclusion The AI tool is a promising innovation for the current systematic reviewing practice, as long as it is appropriately used and methodological quality can be assured.

Rayyan takes a minimalist approach, placing more of the logistical and workflow burden on the users themselves. Many of the peripheral features (e.g., highlighting, tagging, etc.) are comparable. Covidence works well and is well suited for more rigorous systematic reviews, where methodology must be adhered to and documented at each stage.

The Rust programming language implements ownership via the borrow checker, a static analyzer that extends the core type system. The borrow checker is a notorious learning barrier for new Rust users. In this paper, I focus on the gap between understanding ownership in theory versus its implementation in the borrow checker. As a sound and incomplete analysis, compiler errors may arise from either ownership-unsound behavior or limitations of the analyzer. Understanding this distinction is essential for fixing ownership errors. But how are users actually supposed to make the correct inference? Drawing on my experience with using and teaching Rust, I explore the many challenges in interpreting and responding to ownership errors. I also suggest educational and automated interventions that could improve the usability of ownership.","2021-09-22","2024-07-10 21:29:33","2024-07-10 21:29:33","2024-07-10 21:29:33","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2011.06171 [cs]","Comment: HATRA @ SPLASH 2020","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\3KC2DWGV\Crichton - 2021 - The Usability of Ownership.pdf; C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\98346VRH\2011.html","","","Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction; Computer Science - Programming Languages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2011.06171","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Information technologies are used at all stages: from personnel selection to payroll, accounting for pension contributions and recording the chronology of advanced training courses completed by each employee. Of course, in companies with a large staff, processing such a large volume of information would take a lot of time; in addition, it would be necessary to increase the staff of the HR department itself, which would lead to an increase in the company's operating costs. At the same time, the acquisition and use of the latest information technologies in the work of the HR department also entails a number of costs. The work contains the general structure of existing modern products for digitalization of personnel management. Also, the main factors contributing to the widespread introduction of information technologies in the field of personnel management have been identified. The main obstacles to the development of information technologies in the area under study are considered. Unfortunately, not all companies today are ready to incur the costs of the latest technologies and digitalization of a number of person management activities.

As a consequence, this paper discusses the current physical infrastructure, broadband speed, and increasing bandwidth, that has lead to the transition of the television, radio broadcasting, and print media to digital technology convergence. The convergence of new technology is expected to continue evolving over the next decade, creating new opportunities and challenges. Location based services are expected to evolve through devices or objects with radio frequency identification (RFID) and Global Positioning System (GPS) connectivity. Traditional and new media are and will keep on increasing the social networking market due to the growth in online advertising revenue.

While Information Systems (IS) research is in the beginning to explore POIT, the full complexity of the ownership phenomenon has not yet been understood. Here, we draw on psychological ownership theory to propose an extended view on POIT. Choosing a grounded theory methodology, we gathered original data (20 expert interviews, 5 and more years of work experience) and discovered “Appreciation of Technology” as a key characteristic of psychological ownership which has not been considered so far. Additionally, we identified three new antecedents (“Freedom of Choice”, “Multi-Context Use” and “Surveillance”) and one new effect (“Exception Handling”) of psychological ownership of IT. Along with previous studies, our extended view provides a new lens through which ownership and technology acceptance can be viewed and BYOD phenomena better understood. Based on these new insights, we derive several implications for theory and practice.","2016","2024-07-16 14:52:55","2024-07-16 14:53:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\66BQCH74\Klesel et al. - 2016 - EXPLORING PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP OF IT AN EMPIRI.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New actors, most notably universities, have become involved. These changes threaten technological advance by hindering the emergence and utilization of design spaces, understood as metaphorical toolboxes shared by professions and comprised of basic elements and their relations routinely used for problem solving. While abstract, broad, and low‐quality intellectual property per se constitutes a problem, it is particularly so when it comes to a design space, in the context of which knowledge has to be accessed in bundles, and large domains of further inquiry are at stake. The article calls for action in securing technological commons that, at least historically, have been provided via publicly funded research at universities and elsewhere.","2009-01","2024-07-16 16:16:54","2024-07-16 16:16:54","2024-07-16 16:16:54","195-217","","1-2","26","","Review of Policy Research","Are Intellectual Property Rights Hindering Technological Advance?","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\EGP6VWR9\Rouvinen and Stankiewicz - 2009 - Are Intellectual Property Rights Hindering Technol.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the Indian IT sector has expanded quickly and has significantly boosted the economy of the nation. When seen in this light, intellectual property protection becomes crucial for IT companies to preserve their competitive edge and sustain growth. Advancements, patents, copyrights, and other types of intellectual property are all legally protected under IPR. It allows IT companies to make money off of their breakthroughs and stop unauthorized use of their ideas. For instance, copyrights and patents both protect creative works, while copyrights only protect technological inventions. IPR is essential in luring international investors into the Indian IT sector, as well. When a nation offers sufficient protection for intellectual property, investors are more willing to invest there. As a result, a strong IPR environment in India ensures that IT enterprises can get money, thereby assisting with their growth and expansion ambitions. A key element of India's IT sector is intellectual property rights.

However, European civil law does not reflect this development adequately. In fact, so far, European civil law seems to struggle with handling data as a legal entity. Against this background, the article provides a transnational overview and a comprehensive analysis of the legal situation in Europe. It discusses why data ownership is widely perceived as a problem on this side of the Atlantic and how this perception can be overcome by a fundamental property law approach. Taking into account economic realities, we argue that European property law provides a sufficient framework for establishing a theoretical concept of data ownership. Therefore, we draft the dimensions of a data ownership concept by proposing potential criteria for assigning ownership and analyzing both positive access and negative restriction rights.","","2024-07-17 01:19:00","2024-07-17 01:19:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\5P6YMNXT\Boerding et al. - Data Ownership—A Property Rights Approach from a E.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, property rights theory is distinct from these contractual theories. The objectives of the current paper are to analyze extant property rights theory and to connect property rights theory to more mainstream strategic management perspectives of transaction costs theory and agency theory. We then illustrate fundamental theoretical principles derived from these three organizational economic theories by analyzing the business case of oil field unitization (where a single firm is designated as the unit operator to develop the oil reservoir as a whole) in the United States. Theoretical principles and application of theory to the business case of oil field unitization are each summarized in table format. By comparing the different theoretical perspectives, it is possible to see how property rights theory is well suited to explain business situations where inefficient economic outcomes persist. Furthermore, property rights theory complements transaction costs and agency theories by addressing strategic questions of shared ownership, such as joint ventures, and intellectual property rights. As a general theory of contractual choice, property rights theory bridges the differences between agency and transaction costs theories by requiring residual control rights to match residual rights to income in conceptualizing ownership. Through ownership, property rights theory clarifies the firm's boundary choice. Additionally, property rights theory forges new theoretical connections with other branches of organizational economics that are relevant to strategic management, in particular, resource-based theory.","2002-01-01","2024-07-17 01:25:16","2024-07-17 01:25:16","","","","","","","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, College of Business, Working Papers","Property Rights Theory, Transaction Costs Theory, and Agency Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\Y4MW9NUV\Kim and Mahoney - 2002 - Property Rights Theory, Transaction Costs Theory, .pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4893057_Property_Rights_Theory_Transaction_Costs_Theory_and_Agency_Theory_An_Organizational_Economics_Approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers have proposed models linking ownership of software artifacts with developer performance and code quality. Our study aims to systematically examine various ownership models and provide a structured literature overview. Conducting a systematic literature review, we identified 79 relevant papers published between 2005 and 2022. We developed a taxonomy of ownership artifacts based on type, owners, and degree of ownership, along with compiling modeling variables and analytics types used in each study. Additionally, we assessed the replication status of each study. As a result, we identified nine distinct software artifacts whose ownership has been discussed in the literature, with ""Code"" being the most frequently analyzed artifact. We found that only three papers (3.79%) provided code and data, whereas nine papers (11.4%) provided only data. Using our systematic literature review results, we replicated experiments on nine priority projects at \texttt{Brightsquid}. The company aimed to compare its code quality against ownership factors in other teams, so we conducted a replication study using their data. Unlike prior studies, we found no strong correlation between minor contributors and bug numbers. Surprisingly, we found no strong link between the total number of developers modifying a file and bug counts, contrasting previous findings. However, we observed a significant correlation between major contributors and bug counts, diverging from earlier research.","2024-05-24","2024-07-24 17:53:25","2024-07-24 17:53:25","2024-07-24 17:53:24","","","","","","","Examining Ownership Models in Software Teams","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2405.15665 [cs]","Comment: Pre-print an accepted paper for the ESE journal","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\V9L43FCH\Koana et al. - 2024 - Examining Ownership Models in Software Teams A Sy.pdf; C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\37NVS4KM\2405.html","","","Computer Science - Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2405.15665","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on the relational transactions in China, this study analyses the right to data portability from three aspects: transaction boundaries, transaction frequency, and exclusive nature. From the viewpoint of transaction uncertainty, it is necessary to clarify the content of transaction data and define the property rights boundary. From the view of transaction frequency, more detailed regulation of data processing mode is needed to reduce transaction costs in the future. The data processing mode needs to find a balance between security and rapidness. The data processing mode should imitate distributed data transfer protocol or decentralized recommendation system. From the perspective of asset exclusivity, data sharing should be classified for different users. The relationship between user privacy and data sharing should be properly balanced to prevent a ""one-size-fits-all"" data management model. This study applies property rights theory to address the issue of data portability, focuses on the economic benefits brought by data portability, and expands the perspective of the data portability’s nature. Based on relational transactions in China, this study enriches the research of personal data protection in developing countries. In addition, the results provide a theoretical basis for government management, help define the boundary of digital assets, promote the digital transformation of cities, and facilitate sustainable economic development.","2023-12-25","2024-07-25 17:53:42","2024-07-25 17:53:42","2024-07-25 17:53:42","1-12","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Wanyi Chen, et al.","","","","ojs.wiserpub.com","","Number: 2","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\ZJILDQBA\Chen and Chen - 2023 - Research on the Personal Data Portability Based on.pdf","","","Personal Information Protection Law; Property rights theory; Relational transactions; The right to data portability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we identify natural heterogeneity in the extent to which different people perceive AI as anthropomorphic. We find that differences in the perception of AI anthropomorphicity are associated with different allocations of responsibility to the AI system, and credit to different stakeholders involved in art production. We then show that perceptions of AI anthropomorphicity can be manipulated by changing the language used to talk about AI –– as a tool vs agent –– with consequences for artists and AI practitioners. Our findings shed light on what is at stake when we anthropomorphize AI systems, and offers an empirical lens to reason about how to allocate credit and responsibility to human stakeholders.","2020-08-01","2024-07-29 17:24:37","2024-07-29 17:24:37","","101515","","","23","","iScience","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\DELL\Zotero\storage\73JW3Q6Q\Epstein et al. - 2020 - Who Gets Credit for AI-Generated Art.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343974447_Who_Gets_Credit_for_AI-Generated_Art","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
